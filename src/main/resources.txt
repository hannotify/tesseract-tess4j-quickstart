A technology that can take written words and convert them
back into computer-readable form, provided they're in the
right font, using the correct colors sometimes, at the right
point size and pitch, dark enough on the paper, and you're
prepared to spend several centuries correcting all the ones
that came out as I's, all the O's that came out as zeroes,
and all the colons that come out like semicolons.
